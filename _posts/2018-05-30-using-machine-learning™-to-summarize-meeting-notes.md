TL;DR: _I made an app that uses technology like such as Machine Learning™ to summarize only the most important bits of your meeting notes._

I just built a nifty tool. I was sitting in a long meeting the other day, and was thinking:

> Oh man. This meeting has really gotten off track. I wish there was a tool out there to
summarize only the important parts of my notes I'm taking.

# The wait is over.

I'm releasing it today absolutely free*. 

###### *All I ask is that you don't sue me when I might want to monetize it in the future by selling every single piece of data you put into my app.
